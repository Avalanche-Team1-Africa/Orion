# Tokenizing the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) on Avalanche and Cardano  

## Problem Statement  

Investing in the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) is currently inaccessible for many Kenyans due to:  
- High barriers to entry (high brokerage fees, minimum capital requirements).  
- Slow settlement times (T+3 days for trades to finalize).  
- Limited liquidity for small investors due to low trading volumes.  
- Complex onboarding (lengthy paperwork, bank requirements).  

As a result, less than 1% of Kenyans directly own shares, despite growing mobile money adoption.  

## Our Solution: A Blockchain-Powered Stock Exchange  

We are tokenizing NSE-listed stocks on the Avalanche and Cardano blockchain, enabling:  

✅ Instant, low-cost trading – Buy/sell shares in seconds with minimal fees.  
✅ Mobile-first investing – Trade directly from your phone via a simple app.  
✅ Fractional ownership – Invest small amounts (as low as KES 100).  
✅ Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading – Users trade tokenized shares without intermediaries.  
✅ Automated liquidity – Our system, Orion, ensures seamless buy/sell execution.  

## How It Works  

1. Tokenization – Each NSE stock is represented as a Avalanche and Cardano token (1 token = 1 share).  
2. Onboarding – Users deposit funds via M-Pesa, buy tokens, and receive them in their Avalanche and Cardano wallet.  
3. Trading – Users trade tokens instantly (P2P or via Orion’s liquidity pool).  
4. Settlement – Transactions settle in seconds (vs. days on traditional exchanges).  

## Why This Works  

🚀 Avalanche and Cardano’s Advantages – Low fees, fast transactions, and regulatory-friendly compliance.  
📱 Mobile Money Integration – Leveraging Kenya’s high mobile penetration (M-Pesa, Airtel Money).  
💡 Democratizing Investing – Opens the stock market to millions of unbanked & underbanked Kenyans.  
💰 New Revenue Streams – Liquidity provision, transaction fees, and premium services.
